      <h1>Writing as design</h1>

      <p>
        There&apos;s continuing debate over whether
        <a
          href="https://medium.com/ux-immersion-interactions/the-power-of-experience-mapping-212ba81e5ee"
          target="_blank"
          >everyone is a designer</a
        >. The argument if this is true or not is still ongoing, but can writing
        be part of the design process? Is writing, itself, design?
      </p>

      <p>
        I personally come from a design background. I studied graphic design at
        college and university with the intent of becoming a ‘Graphic
        Designer&apos;. After doing some freelance branding work, I then worked
        as a Web Designer professionally.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I saw a new opportunity and I went for it. I&apos;m now a content
        writer and loving it. From what I&apos;ve seen this is a slightly
        different path to get to this role. Most of my peers come from an
        English studies background. I believe my knowledge and skills in design
        have influenced how I write and understand what I&apos;m writing for,
        giving me a unique perspective. For me, I see content writing
        (especially for services) as an extension of my design knowledge, but
        can I say I “design with words”?
      </p>

      <h2>Big picture, small details</h2>

      <p>
        Writing is big picture. It gives you an understanding of processes and
        the narrative you audience expect from your service. By writing you can
        design the service. This might seem odd when you think of design as
        purely the visual elements. But for products and services (or service
        design) you&apos;re having a conversation with the user. A lot of
        <a
          href="https://medium.com/blablacar-design/how-content-revolutionised-the-way-we-do-product-design-cbeb3a3c7ab6"
          target="_blank"
          >content designers start designing the service by writing out the
          conversation you expect the user to have with it</a
        >. This way you can structure the service more organically and as they
        would expect to interact with it. This is why it&apos;s crucial to
        include content designers at the start of any service project. If you
        can understand how users “talk” to the service you can make sure the
        service is built to answer them.
      </p>

      <p>
        As well as the broader ideas writing also lets you consider the smaller
        details. The attention to detail needed is fundamental, especially when
        writing shorter, to-the-point content. It&apos;s important when writing
        for the web to write clearly and concisely,
        <a
          href="https://blog.prototypr.io/writing-for-the-web-and-content-design-c6416abb9bc5"
          target="_blank"
          >I cover the research done for this in a previous article</a
        >. This is especially important with services where your content may
        just be field titles, help text and other
        <a
          href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-magic-of-microcopy-a56c5decbe1f"
          target="_blank"
          >microcopy</a
        >. Your content needs to be direct and informative in the fewest amount
        of words. It&apos;s also important that these few words have clarity and
        aren&apos;t misconstrued by the user. Every word must be deliberated and
        debated to make sure the context and inference is properly understood
        and considered. In my own work I&apos;ve spent up to 40 minutes on just
        one sentence, discussing with other content designers. You don&apos;t
        want your audience to misunderstand, and worse take offense to what
        you&apos;re saying to them.
      </p>

      <h2>Design is communication</h2>

      <p>
        What&apos;s the purpose of design? It&apos;s more than just making
        things look pretty, it&apos;s fundamentally about communication and this
        is the same for writing. This is why design and writing are naturally
        linked. They don&apos;t need to function and develop separately -
        services are better off if they don&apos;t. It&apos;s well understood
        that making your content
        <a
          href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/02/17/guest-post-clarity-is-king-the-evidence-that-reveals-the-desperate-need-to-re-think-the-way-we-write/"
          target="_blank"
          >plain English is the best way to make sure it&apos;s understood</a
        >
        by all. This is how, as writers for the web, we communicate. With short,
        concise sentences that are direct, yet conversational we can make sure
        the user fully understands what they have to do. This is crucial to the
        design because without words the users would be lost.
      </p>

      <p>
        Designers are precious of their title - and rightly so! They&apos;ve
        studied and worked a long time to get to where they are. But design is a
        multifaceted practice. It&apos;s becoming more understood and encouraged
        for
        <a href="https://uxclub.com/posts/designing-with-words" target="_blank"
          >designers to learn to write</a
        >. This is so they can communicate their ideas and how their designs
        have developed. What&apos;s slowly becoming more realised is that
        writers are also part of design and we
        <a
          href="https://medium.com/@jsaito/how-to-design-words-63d6965051e9"
          target="_blank"
          >design with our words</a
        >. By writing we can understand the flow and narrative a product or
        service should follow.
      </p>

      <h2>In summary</h2>

      <p>
        Design has multiple disciplines. It&apos;s not just branding or
        infographics. There&apos;s graphic design, web design and digital design
        as well as many others such as book design and typographic design.
        It&apos;s not just what you see, such as the front end in web design.
        It&apos;s also the structures that hold the design behind it, whether
        that&apos;s the grids in a book design or the information architecture
        of a website.
      </p>

      <p>
        A crucial component in a lot of design are the words. They&apos;re often
        what you see first on a website, in a book as well as in branding and
        infographics. They&apos;re often the main component users and viewers
        interact with, because of this it&apos;s important the words you use are
        understandable and correct.
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore, I think it&apos;s right that writing is considered part of
        design. It&apos;s an integral part of the process and the final outcome.
        It&apos;s also how those who design record their processes, patterns and
        research. Its apparent at all stages of design. So you can design by
        writing and writing can be design.
