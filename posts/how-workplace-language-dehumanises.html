      <h1>How workplace language dehumanises</h1>

      <p>
        As content designers and UX writers, we&apos;re specialists in language.
        But it&apos;s not just the words we read and write that are important.
        Spoken language is crucial to understanding our users&apos; needs and
        what they do and don&apos;t understand.
      </p>

      <p>
        However the words we use internally, as an organisation, also has a huge
        impact. We can get bogged down in technical, business terms that do
        nothing but make us sound weird. Something I&apos;ve noticed is this is
        common with the way we talk about people.
      </p>

      <h2>Language that excludes</h2>

      <p>
        I&apos;ve worked in a few different industries, but the way we talk
        about people is similar. It&apos;s dehumanising. For some reason,
        managers can&apos;t talk about people as exactly that — people.
      </p>

      <p>I&apos;ve come across some examples like:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>resource</li>

        <li>capacity</li>

        <li>full time equivalent (FTE)</li>

        <li>band threes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In some circumstances, talking about the “available capacity” makes
        sense. But a lot of the time it&apos;s used as a blanket term for
        individuals who do “the work”. This is the same with all these examples
        — it negatively reinforces hierarchy. It removes any personality and
        emotion from the individuals. It reduces them to nothing more than
        numbers on a spreadsheet.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&apos;m sure for a lot of companies, this is exactly why. When
        discussing and planning large amounts of people you&apos;ll use blanket
        terms for ease. However, this drip feeds down so that even team managers
        will use it when talking about 2 or 3 people. This use of language may
        not seem like a big deal, but we could easily define them as
        microaggressions. When these add up they can negatively impact team
        morale and how people value their work and input.
      </p>

      <h2>Speaking upwards and downwards</h2>

      <p>
        In my experience, this language is exclusively used for those who sit
        lower down on the organisational structure. When people talk about those
        above them they use more powerful language, like:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Execs</li>

        <li>Directors</li>

        <li>The board</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This language isn&apos;t anymore sensitive to people as individuals. But
        it does resonate with power and authority. Again, this reinforces
        hierarchy.
      </p>

      <h2>Inclusive language</h2>

      <p>
        This reinforcement of hierarchy is typical of an old-style company. What
        we&apos;re seeing now is companies trying to reframe how they talk to
        their employees.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, Google is famous for calling it&apos;s people Googlers. And
        they call their new employees Nooglers, combining ‘new&apos; with
        ‘Googler&apos;. While there&apos;s some differences between Nooglers and
        Googlers, this is more inclusive. It&apos;s easy to see how this tries
        to include you as part of the company and its culture.
      </p>

      <h2>Appreciate people</h2>

      <p>
        To motivate people, making their work feel meaningful, let&apos;s start
        by appreciating them. We can stop using language that removes their
        humanity and abilities — we&apos;re not ‘resources&apos;! — and start
        calling people ‘people&apos;. We can use each other&apos;s names and
        refer to ‘the team&apos; collectively. Let&apos;s be nice, friendly and
        helpful.
      </p>

      <p>Let&apos;s include everyone. It&apos;s not difficult.</p>
