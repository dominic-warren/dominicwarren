        A late write-up of my &apos;lunch and learn&apos; session at Clearleft
      </h1>

      <p>
        On the 14 June 2019, I spoke at
        <a href="https://clearleft.com/" target="_blank">Clearleft</a>, in
        Brighton. I was just there for an hour, doing a &apos;lunch and
        learn&apos; (or &apos;brown bag&apos;) session. But it was a really
        valuable experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Firstly, I really appreciated being invited. Clearleft is a company
        I&apos;ve followed since early in my career. As one of the leading UX
        agencies in Brighton, they do some excellent work. I&apos;m also
        privileged to be friends with some members of Clearleft â€” an added
        bonus!
      </p>

      <p>
        I&apos;d only been at TrustedHousesitters for a little while at the
        time. So it was interesting to make the presentation and formulate my
        ideas and talking points. My talk was on: &apos;How a writer works
        within the design team&apos;.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was really nice to talk about something more focused, talking about
        the projects I&apos;ve actually worked on. As opposed to the abstract
        general principles of UX writing. Everyone who attended seemed
        interested and there were lots of great questions. Some of them I had to
        take away to think over. But it was good to have the question and answer
        session to peel back the layers of what I&apos;d covered.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hope everyone who attended found it useful and interesting. I
        certainly benefited from getting out of my comfort zone. Talking to a
        small audience was fun and I&apos;d definitely do it again.
      </p>
