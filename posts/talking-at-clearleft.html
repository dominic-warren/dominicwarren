<h1>A late write-up of my &apos;lunch and learn&apos; session at Clearleft</h1> 

<p>On the 14 June 2019, I spoke at <a href="https://clearleft.com/" target="_blank">Clearleft</a>, in Brighton. I was just there for an hour, doing a &apos;lunch and learn&apos; (or &apos;brown bag&apos;) session. But it was a really valuable experience.</p> 



<p>Firstly, I really appreciated being invited. Clearleft is a company I&apos;ve followed since early in my career. As one of the leading UX agencies in Brighton, they do some excellent work. I&apos;m also privileged to be friends with some members of Clearleft â€” an added bonus!</p> 



<p>I&apos;d only been at TrustedHousesitters for a little while at the time. So it was interesting to make the presentation and formulate my ideas and talking points. My talk was on: &apos;How a writer works within the design team&apos;.</p> 



<p>It was really nice to talk about something more focused, talking about the projects I&apos;ve actually worked on. As opposed to the abstract general principles of UX writing. Everyone who attended seemed interested and there were lots of great questions. Some of them I had to take away to think over. But it was good to have the question and answer session to peel back the layers of what I&apos;d covered.</p> 



<p>I hope everyone who attended found it useful and interesting. I certainly benefited from getting out of my comfort zone. Talking to a small audience was fun and I&apos;d definitely do it again.</p>
