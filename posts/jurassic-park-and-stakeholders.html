      <p>
        Dealing with stakeholders is notoriously one of the hardest parts of
        working in Digital. There are conflicting priorities and agendas that
        Digital, when making a product or service, need to bring together into
        some kind of consensus.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are plenty of Medium articles covering the techniques and skills
        you can use to work and collaborate with stakeholders more effectively.
        It&apos;s something I am definitely still exploring and learning about
        myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most obvious issue that happens across organisations and companies
        though is that stakeholders and project teams don&apos;t learn from past
        mistakes.
      </p>

      <h3>Jurassic Park</h3>

      <p>
        There&apos;s a theme park. Everyone gets attacked. Theme park gets
        destroyed.
      </p>

      <h3>The Lost World: Jurassic Park</h3>

      <p>
        New island discovered, new theme park is made. Everyone gets attacked.
      </p>

      <h3>Jurassic Park III</h3>

      <p>Everyone gets attacked. The island (pretty much) gets destroyed.</p>

      <h3>Jurassic World</h3>

      <p>New theme park. Everyone gets attacked. Theme park gets destroyed.</p>

      <h3>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</h3>

      <p>Probably a new theme park. Everyone probably gets attacked.</p>

      <p>
        Jurassic Park screams of a project that&apos;s had a lot of various
        stakeholder input at the end. Whoever&apos;s in charge of the many
        Jurassic Parks is not learning their lesson. And if it&apos;s different
        people starting new parks, they aren&apos;t looking at what their
        predecessors have done — and more importantly, what they did wrong.
      </p>

      <p>There&apos;s a saying that I hear a lot:</p>

      <p class="quote">
        “the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and
        expecting different results” — (generally cited as Albert Einstein,
        although
        <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/03/23/same/" target="_blank"
          >more likely one of the twelve-step communities</a
        >)
      </p>

      <p>
        Obviously this doesn&apos;t apply to every situation, but Jurassic Park
        is a great example. And when it comes to projects, if you repeat the
        same mistakes, the results certainly won&apos;t change.
      </p>

      <p>
        When working on projects, it&apos;s best to keep stakeholders to a
        minimum. If there&apos;s lots of teams that need to have input, they
        could have a delegate who&apos;s trusted to make those decisions. By
        working with other teams you&apos;ll understand the difficulties they
        had before.
      </p>

      <p>
        But, it&apos;s not just what went wrong or went badly. It&apos;s what
        they did to overcome it, what they did to fix it, and what they did to
        make it better.
      </p>
