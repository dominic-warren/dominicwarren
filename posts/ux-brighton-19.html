      <h1>Write-up of UX Brighton 2019</h1>

      <p>
        I’ve finally got myself to a UX Brighton conference! I’ve been to a
        couple of evening events, but it was great to get to the main event. It
        was a good way to get to know my new teammates more. And an opportunity
        to catch up with old contacts and friends.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a good variety of talks that were all interesting in their own
        way.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was nice to see UX writing getting mentioned here and there.

        discussed it in his talk, comparing “new practises” with historical
        examples. It was really great to see these comparisons brought forward.
        I particularly liked how earlier copywriting combined with design into
        creative teams. Much like what we want from UX writing now.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were a couple of talks on voice design, which I found particularly
        interesting. Although, I would have liked more around designing the
        specific words and phrases.

        mentioned their healthcare voice ended communications with “Take care.”
        They had originally gone with “Hope you feel better soon!” in an overly
        happy tone. But this was seen as unhelpful and not always accurate (for
        obvious reasons!). So it was nice to hear how they considered this.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were a few mentions, and a whole talk from
        <a href="https://twitter.com/doctorfine" target="_blank"
          >Dr. Nick Fine</a
        >, about bringing science and “science thinking” into our practise. I
        really like this side of the conversation, so it was good to see it at
        the conference.
      </p>

      <p>
        All in all it was a great event. It would be nice to see something
        similar happening for UX writing and content. Or maybe a future UX
        Brighton theme around it. There are so many connections and comparisons.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like all these events, it’s nice to know we’re all having similar
        problems and challenges. But it’s probably worth us trying to open these
        events out to stakeholders. Then they hear these things first-hand and
        can the great speakers can help convince them.
