      <h1>Sentence case or title case?</h1>

      <p>
        How we read on the web is becoming more and more understood. Gone are
        the days of sparkly “Word art” and wild coloured backgrounds (<a
          href="http://www.dpgraph.com/"
          target="_blank"
          >although not entirely</a
        >). User research and user experience (UX) design is encouraged to
        explore further. However, there’s long been an argument between using
        title case or sentence case.
      </p>

      <p>
        When writing for the web your titles and headings are one of the most
        important things you need to consider. But it’s not just what you write
        for your titles, but how they’re written. There’s pros and cons for both
        sentence and title case - but it’s also worth considering how readers
        perceive these within the context of the format. The format of your
        content must be consistent if you want clear readability.
      </p>

      <h2>Sentence case</h2>

      <p>
        Sentence case is when only the first letter of the first word in a title
        (and any proper noun) is capitalised, such as:
      </p>

      <p class="quote">This is a sentence case title</p>

      <p>
        The use of upper case throughout words affects the shape of the word.
        Some believe that, when reading, the shape of the word is what we
        actually recognise. In
        <a
          href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-we-read-we-recognize-words-as-pictures-and-hear-them-spoken-aloud/"
          target="_blank"
          >one study, researchers presented the subjects with a series of real
          words and made up words</a
        >. The made up words elicited responses from a wide pool of neurons in
        the brain, while distinct groups of neurons responded to real words.
        After subjects were trained to recognise the made up words, neurons
        responded as they did to real words.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, some believe it’s a myth that the shape of the word affects how
        we read. A
        <a
          href="http://www.graphics.com/article-old/how-people-read"
          target="_blank"
          >study by Kenneth Paap (1984) and Keith Rayner (1998)</a
        >
        revealed that when we read, we recognise and anticipate letters. Based
        on those letters we then recognise the word.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sentence case is also more like how humans communicate. We don’t use
        title case for texts, emails and letters.
        <a
          href="https://material.io/guidelines/style/writing.html#writing-tone"
          target="_blank"
          >Your writing on the web should be conversational and approachable.</a
        >
        Writing as humans naturally do is a good way of doing this.
        <a
          href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nRDMeVvhGfcC&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=writing+on+the+web+should+be+conversational&source=bl&ots=elaThRJUee&sig=DRiYz3NFmYK78E5brAHj9BQSJnI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjFy5qr7d_TAhXrI8AKHRE1DY4Q6AEIXDAI#v=onepage&q=writing%20on%20the%20web%20should%20be%20conversational&f=false"
          target="_blank"
          >If your writing doesn’t feel natural or approachable it distances the
          reader.</a
        >
        It should be written how you speak, only better - editing the phrases to
        be succinct and precise.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s lack of authority means sentence case may not be considered
        “serious” enough for a certain theme of content. Also, title case
        clearly defines the line of content as a heading. If headings aren’t
        made clear enough it may not draw the eye in the same way title case
        does.
      </p>

      <h2>Title case</h2>

      <p>
        Title case is when the first letter of each word is capitalised, such
        as:
      </p>

      <p class="quote">This Is a Title Case Title</p>

      <p>
        Considered traditional, title case is generally associated with
        authority and importance. It’s mostly used for newspapers and
        <a
          href="http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2012/03/title-case-and-sentence-case-capitalization-in-apa-style.html"
          target="_blank"
          >academic publications</a
        >. Front loaded, meaningful headings within content are one of the ways
        <a
          href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/"
          target="_blank"
          >we navigate a page</a
        >. Headings within bodies of text that use title case draw the reader’s
        eye and provides emphasis.
      </p>

      <p>
        One problem with title case is knowing what to capitalise. Some people
        capitalise the first letter of every word. This is OK until it starts
        creeping throughout the page, overwhelming the content. Lots of
        capitalisation, especially
        <a
          href="http://uxmovement.com/content/all-caps-hard-for-users-to-read/"
          target="_blank"
          >all capitals, also reduces legibility</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        However others don’t capitalise words with 3 letters or less, or
        determiners, such as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>the</li>

        <li>of</li>

        <li>for</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This can get confusing for writers who aren’t sure, but also the
        <a
          href="http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/consistency-key-to-a-better-user-experience/"
          target="_blank"
          >lack of consistency can disrupt the reader</a
        >. Consistency isn’t just about the tone and voice. The way it’s written
        is important because that’s what the reader sees first. Also, we don’t
        read in a expected, fluid way - we
        <a
          href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/saccade"
          target="_blank"
          >saccade</a
        >. This means the eye moves rapidly, flitting from one point of the page
        to the other in no particular order.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having clear titles helps engage the reader’s saccade - this is called
        dominance.
        <a href="http://vanseodesign.com/web-design/dominance/" target="_blank"
          >Dominance is a web design principle.</a
        >
        Using varying levels of headings - for example h1, h2, h3 - allows the
        user to instinctively understand the hierarchy of the page.
      </p>

      <h2>In summary</h2>

      <p>
        Both title and sentence case have their benefits. Their use is more
        applicable in some contexts rather than others because the reader
        considers them differently.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, for me, sentence case is better. Its cleaner, clearer and
        neater on the page. Title case is better for printed newspapers and
        headlines. But, for writing for the web, sentence case is more
        appropriate because of how people read online and it’s more
        conversational manner.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a
          href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/applying-writing-guidelines-web-pages/"
          target="_blank"
          >The most important thing to remember is consistency.</a
        >
        To reflect your decision on title or sentence case produce a style guide
        for your brand or service. Make sure the style guide is referred to and
        used throughout the product. Inconsistencies are more distracting, and
        more obvious than you might think, for the reader.
