<p class="intro">Hello! I'm Dominic, a UX writer in Brighton. I write for the products at <a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/" target="_blank">Brandwatch</a>.</p> 



<p class="intro">I design through words, making sure information is clear and solves user needs.</p> 



<div class="hp-block"></div> 



<p>I started my career as a digital designer where I learnt the importance of clear, simple information.</p> 



<p>Then I moved into online publishing, helping manage the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/valuation-office-agency" target="_blank">Valuation Office Agency</a>’s intranet and GOV.UK content. That’s where I was introduced to the <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Government Digital Service (GDS)</a> and their content design principles.</p> 



<p>Developing my skills for clear writing on the web and information architecture, I found a new place at <a href="https://www.rsagroup.com/" target="_blank">RSA</a>. I worked on making complex insurance information clear. I collaborated with UX and UI designers as well as legal and technical teams.</p> 



<p>I then moved to <a href="https://www.trustedhousesitters.com/" target="_blank">TrustedHousesitters</a>, applying my skills to leisure and travel. I was particularly focused on how content was written across both the website and the app and playing with a totally different tone of voice.</p> 



<p>I now work at Brandwatch. Here I’m writing for complicated data analytics and social intelligence, trying to make the complex simple.</p> 



<p>To help me understand my role, I have written a number of <a href="/writing">posts on UX writing</a>.</p> 



<p>On the side I also interview other writers in tech on <a href="https://medium.com/everywordmatters" target="_blank">every word matters</a>.</p> 



<p>You can follow me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominicwarren123/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@dominicwarren1" target="_blank">Medium</a>.</p>
